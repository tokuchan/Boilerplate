There is much to do before I can call it a beta release. Please feel free to fork a copy and play around. If you create something cool, I'll happily take pull requests!\r\n\r\n### Bug Reports\r\n\r\nGitHub offers an issue tracker, so if there is a problem that is not resolved by documentation, you can submit a bug report. I cannot promise to get to them right away, but I will look there first when deciding what to do next with this project.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
